# Magic Voicebox

## Description

This device comes in two parts: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is retrofitted to work with a case of pens that resides in a breast pocket. Each pen hole makes a separate connection, allowing a number to be sent to the receiver depending on where the pen is removed and replaced. The receiver resides in a hollow part of a box, where it cannot be seen. Upon receiving a number, it speaks out the digits in a voice when the box is opened. The effect is that even though the box appears empty, it is somehow able to speak and correctly guess the spectator's chosen number.
